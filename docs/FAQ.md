## Low Inertial Data Accuracy
If the status of accelerometer, gyroscope or magnetometer is medium or lower, you can do the following to calibrate it:

- Accelerometer: Move EXRAY™ into 4-6 unique orientation and hold in each orientation for about 1 second.
- Gyroscope: Set EXRAY down on a stationary surface for approximately 2-3 seconds.
- Magnetometer: Rotate EXRAY™ about 180° and back to the beginning position in each axis (roll, pitch and yaw) in about 2 seconds.
